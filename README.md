## User Stories
- I want a random word 5 letter word to be generated when I play and see what letters I have selected
- I want an onscreen keyboard to show letters I can click on
- I want to see spaces for each letter of the current word I'm inputting
- **I want to see these spaces get populated/cleared as I type/hit backspace**
- I want to submit my current word choice with Enter
- I want to see visual feedback for when the letter or word I have input is correct/not correct
- I want to see a settings menu
- I want to see a help menu
- I want to be able to view my stats    

I chose to focus on:
**I want to see these spaces get populated/cleared as I type/hit backspace**

So far, I've been able to implement functionality which populates and removes the square spaces with typed characters, but need to implement backspacing when clicking the backspace button.
